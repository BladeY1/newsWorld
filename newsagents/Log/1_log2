2024-06-19 09:08:15,373 - AgentSharesNewsAction - INFO - Agent student_root shares news news_1: On January 16, 2024, netizens revealed a report letter signed and fingerprinted by multiple students from Huazhong Agricultural University, accusing their supervisor, Professor Huang Feiruo, of academic misconduct such as data tampering and fabricating experimental results.

On February 6, 2024, Huazhong Agricultural University announced the investigation and handling of academic misconduct by teacher Huang. After investigation, Huang's academic misconduct was confirmed, leading to the termination of his employment contract and the withdrawal of papers and projects related to the misconduct.

The whistleblowers, including 11 students from the School of Animal Science and Technology and the College of Veterinary Medicine, detailed various issues in Huang's supervision, including data manipulation and plagiarism.

Huang, a former undergraduate and doctoral student of Huazhong Agricultural University, became a professor in 2017. He has published over 40 SCI papers and led numerous research projects. However, his unethical practices have tarnished his reputation and led to severe consequences.

The incident has raised concerns about academic integrity and the treatment of whistleblowers in academic institutions. It highlights the importance of upholding ethical standards in research and education.

For more details on the investigation and its implications, stay tuned for further updates.
