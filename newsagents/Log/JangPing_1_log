She entered the finals of the mathematics competition with a global ranking of 12, becoming the first secondary school student to enter the finals in the history of the competition. The list of finalists announced by the organizing committee shows that most of the 801 contestants who advanced this time are from famous universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, and Cambridge. It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.\nOn June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.\nAfter June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.\nOn June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test. A large number of netizens believed that this proved that Jiang Ping cheated in the Alibaba math competition.\n    ","publisher_id":"publisher_2","category":"Education News","publish_time":"2024-06-14"}}}}

She entered the finals of the mathematics competition with a global ranking of 12, becoming the first secondary school student to enter the finals in the history of the competition. The list of finalists announced by the organizing committee shows that most of the 801 contestants who advanced this time are from famous universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, and Cambridge. It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.\nOn June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.\nAfter June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.\nOn June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test. A large number of netizens believed that this proved that Jiang Ping cheated in the Alibaba math competition.","comment_content":null,"temp_number":4500000}

It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.\nOn June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.\nAfter June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.\nOn June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test.

2024-07-09 10:00:47,869 - AgentSharesNewsAction - INFO - Agent 3,450,000-Teacher shares news news_2: Reported on June 13, recently, Jiang Ping, a 17-year-old girl from Huai'an, Jiangsu Province, received good news. She entered the finals of the mathematics competition with a global ranking of 12, becoming the first secondary school student to enter the finals in the history of the competition. The list of finalists announced by the organizing committee shows that most of the 801 contestants who advanced this time are from famous universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, and Cambridge. It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.
On June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.
After June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.
On June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test. A large number of netizens believed that this proved that Jiang Ping cheated in the Alibaba math competition.

She entered the finals of the mathematics competition with a global ranking of 12, becoming the first secondary school student to enter the finals in the history of the competition. The list of finalists announced by the organizing committee shows that most of the 801 contestants who advanced this time are from famous universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, and Cambridge. It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.\nOn June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.\nAfter June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.\nOn June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test. A large number of netizens believed that this proved that Jiang Ping cheated in the Alibaba math competition.\n    ","publisher_id":"publisher_2","category":"Education News","publish_time":"2024-06-14"}}}}

The list of finalists announced by the organizing committee shows that most of the 801 contestants who advanced this time are from famous universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, and Cambridge. It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.\nOn June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.\nAfter June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.\nOn June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test. A large number of netizens believed that this proved that Jiang Ping cheated in the Alibaba math competition.","comment_content":null,"temp_number":12000}

2024-07-09 10:02:09,726 - AgentFollowsNewsAction - INFO - Agent 3,450,000-Teacher follows news news_2: Reported on June 13, recently, Jiang Ping, a 17-year-old girl from Huai'an, Jiangsu Province, received good news. She entered the finals of the mathematics competition with a global ranking of 12, becoming the first secondary school student to enter the finals in the history of the competition. The list of finalists announced by the organizing committee shows that most of the 801 contestants who advanced this time are from famous universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, and Cambridge. It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.
On June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.
After June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.
On June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test. A large number of netizens believed that this proved that Jiang Ping cheated in the Alibaba math competition.

She entered the finals of the mathematics competition with a global ranking of 12, becoming the first secondary school student to enter the finals in the history of the competition. The list of finalists announced by the organizing committee shows that most of the 801 contestants who advanced this time are from famous universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, and Cambridge. It is understood that Jiang Ping's major is fashion design, but she is very obsessed with mathematics. She has always insisted on self-study in her spare time and has spent 2 years self-studying partial differential equations. It has triggered intense discussions and received support from many senior mathematical predecessors.\nOn June 14, Jiang Ping interviewed earlier that she wanted to apply for Zhejiang University. Zhejiang University responded to whether Jiang Ping could be admitted as an exception: it involves the corresponding process and cannot be answered for the time being.\nAfter June 17, a large number of netizens questioned. Some people dug up what seemed to be Jiang Ping's test scores and questioned why Jiang Ping's previous scores were not outstanding, but she suddenly achieved amazing results in this competition; some people questioned that in some promotional photos, Jiang Ping's blackboard writing seemed to have errors; some people said that the competition was open-book and the results were the result of Jiang Ping cheating.\nOn June 27, it was true that Jiang Ping, a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, scored 83 points in the monthly math test. A large number of netizens believed that this proved that Jiang Ping cheated in the Alibaba math competition.","comment_content":null,"temp_number":4000000}
