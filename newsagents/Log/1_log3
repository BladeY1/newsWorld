news_id: news_1

I'm assuming that the sender of this event is the world entity, which represents the global academic social network. The target of this event is Student Group, which represents 57 million Chinese students. The news_id refers to the specific news article about Professor Huang's academic misconduct and its consequences.

After investigation, Huang's academic misconduct was confirmed, leading to the termination of his employment contract and the withdrawal of papers and projects related to the misconduct.\n\nThe whistleblowers, including 11 students from the School of Animal Science and Technology and the College of Veterinary Medicine, detailed various issues in Huang's supervision, including data manipulation and plagiarism.\n\nHuang, a former undergraduate and doctoral student of Huazhong Agricultural University, became a professor in 2017. He has published over 40 SCI papers and led numerous research projects. However, his unethical practices have tarnished his reputation and led to severe consequences.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about academic integrity and the treatment of whistleblowers in academic institutions. It highlights the importance of upholding ethical standards in research and education.\n\nFor more details on the investigation and its implications, stay tuned for further updates.","publisher_id":"publisher_1","category":"Education","publish_time":"2024-04-17"}}}}
